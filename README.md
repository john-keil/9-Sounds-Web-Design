# Colin's Web Site ( 9 Sounds).

## About Colin's Website

I am going to share my enthusiasm and interest for tibetan singing bowls with you. Over the past few years I have focused on the creation and use of <strong>sound and vibration</strong> to help me relax. I enjoy using bowls, gongs and drums to create harmonics and vibrations which tune into you. Retreats will be organised for you to share the benefits of meditating in a harmonious congregation of mindful people.

Five Elements Representing Human Body
The “Earth element” represents bones and muscles. The blood, which is connective tissue and of vital importance, is represented by the “Water element.” The “Air element” initiates breath and respiration. The body’s temperature, i.e., the heat generated and absorbed to maintain homeostasis, is represented by the “Fire element.” The human body, created as a vessel containing a canal where the organs are placed, has its emptiness or hollowness represented by the “Space element.”

Mental Health
Ajna Chakra is connected with our lower brain, pituitary gland, spine & sixth sense. It affects the functions of eyes, ears, nose, pineal glands, and psychic or extrasensory perception.
7th Chakra – The Crown Chakra – Sahasrara

Spriritual Health
The final and the topmost Chakra that sits outside of the body is The Crown Chakra. This Chakra is also known as Sahasrara translated into a Thousand Petals.
The violet color indicates of this chakra represents your presence of being beyond the physical connections.
